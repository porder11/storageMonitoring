# Scripts for monitoring storage
Directories might have to be changed.

# Mailing.ps1
This script extracts storage information from the disks on the computer/server it's running on.

By default it extracts data from every disk that has a name. 
You can exclude disks by adding it in a list in the $excludedDisks variable in the scripts.

It extracts the disks name, used storage in %, used storage in GB, free storage in GB, health status and operational status.
